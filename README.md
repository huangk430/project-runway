An Investigation of Classification Methods for [Fashion MNIST Database](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
We explore the KNN, logistic, neural network, and decision tree classifiers with the Fashion MNIST database using sklearn. For each classifier, we chose several hyperparameters to experiment with in training, and looked at the effect that varying values had on the model. After finding the most optimal values for our parameters, we used these values to create a learning curve to examine how training size affects our model. Finally, we use these observations to set parameters in our final classification of our test data.
